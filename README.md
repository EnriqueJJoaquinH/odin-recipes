# The Odin Project's Recipes Project

## Description:

This is the first project of the **Foundations Course** of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It is intended to put in practice the knowledge acquired on basic **HTML** tags and structure, **GIT** version control and **GitHub** repositories management into a simple website with multiple pages. Since CSS and JavaScript have not been covered yet at this point of the curriculum, this project is made entirely on HTML. Future updates will improve the visual design and functionality of this website.
