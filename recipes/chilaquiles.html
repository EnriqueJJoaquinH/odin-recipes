            <p><strong>Chilaquiles</strong> might be one of the most <strong>free-wheeling</strong> and <strong>versatile</strong> dishes Mexican cuisine can offer, since it's basically <strong>fried tortilla</strong> chips soaked on <strong>sauce</strong> with <strong>garnishes</strong> on top. Chilaquiles comes from the nahuatl word <em>chilaquili</em>, which can be translated to <em>"put in chile"</em>.</p>
            <p>The multiple <strong>variations</strong> of the dish range from the <em>type of sauce</em> used, how <em>crispy</em> or <em>soggy</em> the <em>tortilla</em> wedges are, the <em>meat</em> or <em>protein</em> it is served with (shredded chicken, beef, pork, or fried eggs), and the <em>garnishes</em> served on top. Maybe that's the reason it is one of the <em>most popular</em> dishes you can find at breakfast or brunch time in restaurants all around Mexico.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
            <li>4 ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 springs of epazote</li>
            <li>A handful of cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>12 cold or stale tortillas, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>Enough oil to a depth of 1-inch</li>
            <li>2 cup shredded chicken meat</li>
            <li>½ cup Mexican crema (or a substitute such as crème fraiche)</li>
            <li>A handful of thinly sliced white onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup queso fresco cheese (or other garnishing cheese, such as parmesan or romano)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>First cook the tortilla wedges</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If too moist, lay the tortillas out to dry for a few minutes. Otherwise they might absorb too much oil.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep heavy skillet over medium heat until 360 degrees.</li>
            <li>Fry the tortilla wedges in batches until the bubbling has stopped, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set them aside on a tray lined with paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Then cook the chile sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the chile pieces in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir constantly until slightly browned and aromatic.</li>
            <li>Fully submerge the chiles in hot water for about 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate.</li>
            <li>Broil the tomatoes and garlic in a dry skillet over medium-high heat until soft and blackened, about 3 minutes per side. Cool until you can handle them.</li>
            <li>Pull the skin from both tomatoes and garlic cloves. Drain the chiles, and put everything in a blender. Blend until smooth. Press the mixture into a strainer.</li>
            <li>Put oil on a skillet over medium-high heat. When hot enough to sizzle up sharply, add the pure all at once. Stir constantly for about 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and season with salt, epazote, and cilantro. Simmer until reduced to 4½ cups. If not enough sauce, add more chicken broth.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Finally put it all together</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a full boil over medium-high heat. Add in the tortilla chips and the shredded chicken meat. Stir until everything is coated in sauce.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Cover and let stand for about 4 minutes, or until the tortilla chips have softened enough to your liking.</li>
            <li>Serve on deep plates. Drizzle with crema, scatter on the onion slices, and sprinkle with cheese, epazote, and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
