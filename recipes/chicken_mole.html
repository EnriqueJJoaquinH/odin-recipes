    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>First cook the chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add olive oil, swirl to cover the whole pot surface. On batches, sauté the chicken on each side until lightly browned. Put the chicken aside and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Add additional olive oil as needed.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pot. Pour water over the chicken until fully covered. Add onion, garlic cloves, peppercorns, and salt. Reduce to low heat, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer until the chicken is fully cooked, 25 minutes approximately.</li>
        <li>Set aside the chicken. Reserve the broth for later use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Then cook the sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast all chiles in a dry pan over medium heat, stirring constantly until warm and aromatic, for about 3 minutes. Repeat with dinner roll pieces and tortilla strips until lightly browned, for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer toasted chiles, dinner roll pieces, and tortilla strips to a blender. Pour chicken broth over them, allowing them to soak, fully submerged, until softened. Blend the mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook tomatillos and tomatoes in a dry skillet on medium-high heat until soft and blackened, about 3 minutes per side. Place them in the blender.</li>
        <li>Melt lard in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, peanuts, raisins, cumin seeds, thyme, allspice berries, cloves, anise seed, and cinnamon sticks, until onions are soft and gold, for about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove whole spices, add everything to the blender with the chile and tomatoes mixture and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth, chocolate, sugar, and salt. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring until chocolate fully melted and sauce is thickened and slightly reduced, about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Finally put it all together</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>You can either shred the chicken meat and combine with the mole sauce, or serve the whole pieces and pour the mole sauce on top. Add as much sauce as you desire.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Serve with warm tortillas and white rice.</li>
    </ol>
