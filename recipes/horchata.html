    <h5><em>Horchata is a traditional Mexican drink made with rice and cinnamon</em></h5>

    <p>As popular as <strong>Horchata</strong> is in Mexico, it actually has its <em>origin</em> in Valencia, <strong>Spain</strong>. However, Spanish Horchata and Mexican Horchata are <em>not the same</em>, since <strong>Spanish Horchata</strong> uses <strong>tiger nut</strong> as its base, while <strong>Mexican Horchata</strong> uses <strong>rice</strong> as base. Though not the same, both are sweet drinks flavored with cinnamon.</p>
    <p>Horchata has extended through multiple countries and regions. In Mexico, not only <em>every family and restaurant</em> has its own recipe, but there are some <strong>varieties</strong> that uses <strong>almond milk</strong> or <strong>coconut water</strong>. However, every Horchata recipe has <strong>rice</strong> and <strong>cinnamon</strong> as its main ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>4 cups hot water</li>
        <li>8 cups extra water</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the rice and cinnamon stick in a bowl. Add hot water and let it soak overnight, or for about 8 hours.</li>
        <li>The next day, pour the bowl (water, rice, and cinnamon) into a blender, and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a strainer or a sieve. Stir to help the liquid go through. Discard the solids, and repeat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add milk, vanilla extract, and the rest of the water to the mixture. Stir the sugar, adjusting the amount until it fit your taste.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to taste the drink before adding more sugar, and if you feel that the consistency is too dense, add more water.</li>
        <li>Let the drink chill in the fridge. Before serving, don't forget to stir, since the rice mixture tends to settle at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Serve on glasses with ice cubes. You can decorate them with a cinnamon stick, and sprinkle with a pinch of grounded cinnamon on top.</li>
    </ol>
